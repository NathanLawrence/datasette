 Publishing data
=================

Datasette includes tools for publishing and deploying your data to the internet. The ``datasette publish`` command will deploy a new Datasette instance containing your databases directly to a Zeit Now or Heroku hosting account. You can also use ``datasette package`` to create a Docker image that bundles your databases together with the datasette application that is used to serve them.

datasette publish
=================

Once you have created a SQLite database (e.g. using `csvs-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite/>`_) you can deploy it to a hosting account using a single command.

You will need a free hosting account with either `Zeit Now <https://zeit.co/now>`_ or `Heroku <http://heroku.com/>`_. Once you have created your account you will need to install and configure the ``now`` or ``heroku`` command-line tools.

Publishing to Zeit Now
----------------------

To publish your database(s) to a new instance hosted by Zeit Now, create an account there, install the `now cli tool <https://zeit.co/download>`_ and then run the following command::

    datasette publish now mydatabase.db

This will upload your database to Zeit Now, assign you a new URL and install and start a new instance of Datasette to serve your database.

The command will output a URL that looks something like this::

    https://datasette-elkksjmyfj.now.sh

You can navigate to this URL to see live logs of the deployment process. Your new Datasette instance will be available at that URL.

Once the deployment has completed, you can assign a custom URL to your instance using the ``now alias`` command::

    now alias https://datasette-elkksjmyfj.now.sh datasette-publish-demo.now.sh

You can use ``anything-you-like.now.sh``, provided no one else has already registered that alias.

You can also use custom domains, if you `first register them with Zeit Now <https://zeit.co/docs/features/aliases>`_.

Publishing to Heroku
--------------------

To publish your data using Heroku, first create an account there and install and configure the `Heroku CLI tool <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli>`_.

You can now publish a database to Heroku using the following command::

    datasette publish heroku mydatabase.db

This will output some details about the new deployment, including a URL like this one::

    https://limitless-reef-88278.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku

You can specify a custom app name by passing ``-n my-app-name`` to the publish command. This will also allow you to overwrite an existing app.

Custom metadata and plugins
---------------------------

``datasette publish`` accepts a number of additional options which can be used to further customize your Datasette instance.

You can define your own :ref:`metadata` and deploy that with your instance like so::

    datasette publish now mydatabase.db -m metadata.json

If you just want to set the title, license or source information you can do that directly using extra options to ``datasette publish``::

    datasette publish now mydatabase.db \
        --title="Title of my database" \
        --source="Where the data originated" \
        --source_url="http://www.example.com/"

You can also specify plugins you would like to install. For example, if you want to include the `datasette-vega <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-vega>`_ visualization plugin you can use the following::

    datasette publish now mydatabase.db --install=datasette-vega


datasette package
=================

If you have docker installed (e.g. using `Docker for Mac <https://www.docker.com/docker-mac>`_) you can use the ``datasette package`` command to create a new Docker image in your local repository containing the datasette app bundled together with your selected SQLite databases::

    datasette package mydatabase.db

Here's example output for the package command::

    $ datasette package parlgov.db --extra-options="--config sql_time_limit_ms:2500"
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  4.459MB
    Step 1/7 : FROM python:3

     ---> Using cache

    Step 4/7 : RUN pip install datasette
     ---> Using cache
     ---> 340efa82bfd7
    Step 5/7 : RUN datasette inspect parlgov.db --inspect-file inspect-data.json
     ---> Using cache
     ---> 5fddbe990314
    Step 6/7 : EXPOSE 8001
     ---> Using cache
     ---> 8e83844b0fed
    Step 7/7 : CMD datasette serve parlgov.db --port 8001 --inspect-file inspect-data.json --config sql_time_limit_ms:2500
     ---> Using cache
     ---> 1bd380ea8af3
    Successfully built 1bd380ea8af3

You can now run the resulting container like so::

    docker run -p 8081:8001 1bd380ea8af3

This exposes port 8001 inside the container as port 8081 on your host machine, so you can access the application at ``http://localhost:8081/``

A full list of options can be seen by running ``datasette package --help``:
